Day 7 - Wow! Big day! Learned interfaces, concurrency, and parallelism as well as did a couple of programming challenges.

### Reviewed:

* Interfaces
* Goroutines
* WaitGroup
* Channels
* Using range with channels
* Self-invoking anonymous functions

Two really easy programming challenges, but always learn something about Go: [Even or Odd](../practice/codewars/kyu-8-even-or-odd.go) and [Multiply](../practice/codewars/kyu-8-multiply.go)

Day 6 - Learning Structs and Functions. I also started solving programming challenges on Codewars using Go.

### Reviewed:

* Structs
* Functions
* Codewars Programming Challenge: [String Repeat](../practice/codewars/kyu-8-string-repeat.go)

Unlike C, a **struct can be a receiver of a function**, which is really cool! Through the simple Codewars challenge, I learned about the **strings** package in Go, which has a lot of handy functions!

Although I simply labeled the review **Structs** and **Functions**, there was a lot to learn.

Day 5 - Learning data structures. Although I mentioned using Array on Day 4, I am officially learning it and realizing I was technically using a Slice :)

### Reviewed:

* Array
* Slice ( a list )
* Map ( a dictionary )
* Make ( to create reference types )
* Supported functions: len, cap, range, etc.

Day 4 - Wrote a [bubble sort algorithm](../algorithms/sort/bubble-sort.go). First time using arrays in Go, which I haven't reviewed yet and may not be using idiomatically. Used a lot of language features discussed thus far:

* Arrays
* `For` Loop with just a condition.
* `For` Loop with initialization, condition, and post statement.
* Shorthand variable initialization.
* `If` statement.
* `Break` statement.

Day 3 - Reviewed Control Flow. Lots of interesting differences to the `For` Loop and `Switch` Statement. I will mention this in my notes at another time.

### Reviewed:

* For Loop.
* Conditions, Break, and Continue.
* Switch Statements.
* If Statements.

Day 2 - Learning the Go language fundamentals. Learning C this summer paid off, because Go has many similarities!

### Reviewed:

* Packages and member visibility.
* Scope.
* Different ways to create variables.
* Constants.
* Blank Identifier ( similar to Python ).
* Pointers ( similar to C ).
* Used **go fmt**, which I did learn the other day as well.

Day 1 - At the point where I can develop with Go!

* Installed Go.
* Created Go workspace.
* Installed Golang Plugin in JetBrains Webstorm.
* Installed JetBrains Gogland.
* Created [Hello World](../practice/play/hello-world) Program.
* Learned **go run**, **go build**, **go install**
